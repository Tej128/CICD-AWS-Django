# Django CI/CD Deployment with AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Django application using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy with a CI/CD pipeline. By automating the build and deployment process, we ensure efficient, error-free, and fast delivery of software changes to production.

## Highlights
- üöÄ **CI/CD** simplifies software development and deployment, automating code testing, delivery, and deployment.
- üíª AWS services (CodePipeline, CodeDeploy) streamline the deployment process for Django applications.
- üîë **IAM Roles** provide the necessary permissions for EC2 instances and CodeDeploy to work securely.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Ubuntu Server** is used for hosting the Django application.
- üìÅ Configuration files for setting up the CI/CD pipeline are essential for automation.
- üîÑ **CodePipeline** automates the build, test, and deployment stages for your Django project.
- ‚úÖ **Live Deployment** allows you to access the application through a public IP after successful deployment.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the configuration for deploying a Django project to an EC2 instance using **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeDeploy**. The CI/CD pipeline automates the process, reducing the need for manual intervention during deployment, which ensures better software quality and faster releases.

### Key Insights:
- **CI/CD** ensures automated testing, building, and deployment, leading to fewer errors and faster releases.
- **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeDeploy** manage the complexities of deploying Django applications.
- **IAM Roles** are critical for securely assigning permissions to EC2 and CodeDeploy.
- **Ubuntu Server** is recommended for hosting Django applications due to compatibility and ease of use.
- The **Configuration Files** (e.g., `appspec.yml`, `buildspec.yml`, `gunicorn.service`) define the deployment pipeline, providing critical details to automate the build and deployment.
- By using **CodePipeline**, the entire workflow‚Äîfrom code commit to deployment‚Äîis automated, ensuring continuous delivery.
- After successful deployment, your Django application will be accessible via a public IP address.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to access services like CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, and EC2.
- **Django Project**: The Django project should be set up and ready to deploy.
- **IAM Roles**: Ensure proper IAM roles are created with necessary permissions for EC2 and CodeDeploy to function.
